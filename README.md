# Basic Python Algorithms

This repository contains **fundamental algorithm implementations** in Python. These include **sorting, searching, recursion, and mathematical algorithms**, commonly used in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) courses and coding interviews.  

Each script is a **standalone implementation** demonstrating a specific concept with clean and understandable code.

## 📂 **Included Algorithms**

### 🔍 **Searching Algorithms**
1. **Binary Search** – Implements binary search after sorting with bubble sort.
2. **Recursive Binary Search** – A recursive approach to binary search.
3. **Sequential Search** – Searches for an element in a list sequentially.

### 🔢 **Sorting Algorithms**
4. **Bubble Sort** – Sorts a list using the bubble sort technique.
5. **Selection Sort** – Implements the selection sort algorithm.
6. **Insertion Sort** – Implements the insertion sort algorithm.

### 🔣 **Mathematical Algorithms**
7. **GCD.py** – Uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
8. **LCM.py** – Finds the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of given numbers.
9. **Factorial.py** – Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
10. **Fibonacci Series.py** – Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.

### 📊 **Miscellaneous**
11. **Check Parenthesis.py** – Uses a stack to check if parentheses in a string are balanced.
12. **Check Matrices Equality.py** – Compares two matrices for equality.
13. **Largest and Smallest in List.py** – Finds the largest and smallest elements in a list.
